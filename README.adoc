== Introduction
   yalloc is yet another memory allocator with emphasis on efficiency and compactness.

   The main features of this allocator are :

  - segregated metadata / no user block header
    This reduces the risk of metadata corruption and results in a more cache / TLB friendly layout

  - double free and invalid free detection
    With configurable reporting

  - lock, contention and wait free by having a heap per thread

  - modest code size & complexity
    5 KLOC including embedded diagnostic/stats formatter

== Status
  Early stage, work in progress.

== Building
  ./build.sh -g
